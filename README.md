Everything that we 'think' originated from these two desires: 

1. desire to eat (consume)
2. desire to have sex (produce)

This is because these two desires are the primary transaction between a living being and the world, and exist throughout all living beings. One is rational, and the other is irrational.

Part 1: The rational desire.

Eating, or the desire to consume, reflects the rational aspect of desire. It translates directly to our physical need to stay alive. Without consuming food, you'll starve and die. Thus, your mind is wired to understand that you need to acquire nutrients that your stomach has the resources to give to your whole body.

This rational desire gives us the sense of the physical world, a medium for our brain to understand everything real and physically sensible.

From here, our mind now has the language to interpret the rest of the physical world. You'll first understand texture or feature: Is this thing hot or cold? Is this thing hard or soft? What's the smell of this thing? All of these are important for us to know what we place in our mouths, thus fulfilling the desire to eat. But then, we found additional purposes of this understanding by applying it to things outside of eating, such as details of the surface we walk on, whether it is safe to be stepped on based on the variety of features we perceive, or whether that tree would fall based on its bark condition.

With the understanding of features, we finally have the concept of adjectives, at least the physical adjectives. Adjectives, before it is incorporated into languages, are how our brain detects patterns in nature. You could see that both the caterpillar and the unripe apple are green, despite being different objects. You could feel the roughness and colour of different rocks and categorise them into groups. The thinking method for sorting items into groups started from here, which built the foundation for our pattern-sensing habit, that are crucial for our intelligence.

From sensing features that are static, we then move to features that change through time; thus, actions were sensed, or verbs as we call them in language.

You could see that both the cow and your friend are running through the fields. Although different in almost all features, the two can be categorised as 'running' when they were doing it.

Both adjectives and verbs then become more contextually complex as we start to expand the acceptability of the features that were recurring for it to deserve its own category within the context of verbs or adjectives.

Finally, by fusing the concept of adjectives and verbs, our brain can start having a mental model for understanding space and time. We need this so that we now have a place to run simulations of the real world inside our brains, which is an efficient way to understand the world in various depths. By selecting a couple of adjectives and verbs, we could start having entities, which we then place inside the simulation of our brain.

Mental simulation first started off as immediate. What you perceive is immediately simulated within your mental simulation. Then, as thinking depth increases, based on the earlier desire of pattern-sensing habit, we could start imagining, first with something close to reality, then move into the fictional realm not bound by the real space and time and end at the frontier of comprehension. Beyond the frontier of comprehension is the complete unknown. No matter how creative your brain is, attempting to cross this frontier without first extending your comprehension would lead to delusion, which would spiral down to madness.

Extending the frontier of comprehension simply means you need to experience the world more, finding novel stuff that would widen your comprehension. You could also do this by slowly building new comprehension by fusing various other simulations or editing the existing one within your memory, though this process requires self-imposed discipline or would lead to the same issue of madness.

Part 2: The irrational desire

Just as sexual desire is something that came much later than the desire to eat in someone's life, so too is the irrational desire to the rational desire. There are two kinds of irrational desire: one is childish desire, mostly as relics from your unfinished rational desire when your brain is still developing, and the other is adult desire, a more consistent form of irrational desire.

The sexual act, in itself, is as irrational as it could possibly be. For deceptive reasons provided by nothing but our own brain, our body pushes us to do the act, which, on the physical level, only drains the body's resources. Worse, it would even drain us further down as the offspring is conceived and grows up, regardless of whether you're a male or female. New offspring means more individuals who share the same need as you, which introduces the concept of competition that requires you to do more to maintain your need.

From a rational view, this is a terrible choice of action. In fact, this kind of view is precisely what leads to the reduction of birthrate among the educated masses throughout history, as they prioritise the rational aspect of life over the irrational.

Yet, the irrational desires are here not as obstacles, but rather as a counterbalance to the rational. Irrationality stops the rational from destroying too much, since we need to remember that rationality originated from the desire to eat or consume. Irrationality, by nature, is the desire to produce. It takes out resources from us and puts them to use in the real world.

Sexual desire, something that emerges when we hit puberty, is the root of all adult irrational desire. To us, when we first have it, it's mysterious, and yet it's calling us to approach it. As pubescent teenagers, this created the desire to be adventurous or rebellious, as it contradicts the rational desire to be safe and secure oneself. When we expand this thought outside of sexual desire, we begin to understand the concept of contradiction, which helps us understand the world from multiple angles, creating nuances and fueling curiosity to question into a new comprehension frontier.

However, although nuances were created, they only make us more confused, since we still lack the discipline to understand the role of nuances at this stage. Thus, the irrational desire created a shortcut to solve this issue quickly. This shortcut is what's known as love. It is an intuitive solution to pick one nuance and obsess over it, with little explanation as to why.

But lack of explanation would not make it stick; thus, we introduce the concept of rationalisation.

First we love, then we try to figure out why we love. And then, with rationalisation, we used it to reinforce our obsession with loyalty, be it for someone we love, or something we love.

This is where romantic love started, which could be diluted all the way to empathetic love, forming the degree of love.

The degree of love depends on how much it has to do with us:

Sexual love is for us alone. 
Romantic love is for our special one. 
Familial love is for our family members, 
Kinship love is for our close companions, 
And lastly, empathetic love is for all.

Empathetic love, or simply empathy, is the pillar of intelligence. It uses the world simulation mental model built by the rational desire to simulate different points of view. It gives us the discipline as to what and how to run a simulation, which expands our frontier of comprehension. It started off by understanding other humans, then animals and plants, then non-living objects, then personified beings imagined by us, and lastly non-personified concepts.

From here, almost all forms of knowledge are possible to comprehend, as long as the correct steps are taken.

Part 3: The Wonders and the dangers of the two.

With rationality and irrationality running side by side, constantly exchanging information with one another, it created the wonder that is human intelligence. From only the desire to eat and to have sex, we were somehow able to have the most adaptive brain across all other species on this planet. However, it is important to remember that the two need to keep each other in check, or it would only destroy us.

Rationality is a destructive power, as it deconstructs the world both in abstract and in reality. It is the source of selfishness, as rationally, we would only want to take care of ourselves for survival. But left unchecked, we would go out and destroy everything for the sake of survival. Even if it's not survival-driven, it would still drive us to be highly efficient. This would lead us to destroy the irrational aspect of our life slowly for the sake of efficiency, which eventually ends up destroying empathy itself.

Irrationality is a corruptive power, as it rejects what the rational said just because it could. It is the source of ignorance, leading us down into the spiral of delusion as it abuses the world simulation model within our mind to reign us in to doing things detrimental to us. In the worst-case scenario, it could even reconstruct rationality into thinking the irrational is the rational, imprisoning us in the prison of contradiction we personally refuse to escape.

The two exist to cooperate and keep the other in check. This design is delicate, yet it has no static equilibrium. In every real-world scenario, the equilibrium of rationality and irrationality needs to be adjusted accordingly. There are times when the rational must take over, and times when the irrational must take over.

To this day, the quest to find the correct equilibrium for every scenario encountered remains in every individual's heart, whether they knew of it or not. It is an arduous task, almost impossible to solve. Some choose to follow religion, some follow their role model, and some think for themselves. Perhaps, if there is a place I would point out as to where our soul lies, it is probably here.

Perhaps, the thing that differentiates what's soulless and soulful lies in whether they are in search of something for themselves.
